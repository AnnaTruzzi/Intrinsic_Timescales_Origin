# Intrinsic_Timescales_Origin

Thi repository contains the code and information to reproduce the analysis performed in the following pre-print:
Truzzi, A., Cusack, R. (2022 - preprint). "The origin of intrinsic timescales: A comparison between the neonate and adult brain".

The data folder contains participants' code and demographic information as well as the atlases used in the ROI analysis. 

The code folder contains all the code used for the analysis and to produce the figures shown in the paper. 
The script "dhcp_hcp_timescales.py" runs all the analysis by calling onto other scripts.

The code in "dhcp_participants_stats.py" and "hcp_participants_stats.py" instead calculated the demographic measures for each cohort.
