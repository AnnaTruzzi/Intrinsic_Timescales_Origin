# Intrinsic_Timescales_Origin
 
The code shared in this repository is related to the paper titled **"The origin of intrinsic timescales: A comparison between neonate and adult brain"**.

The python scripts named ARMA* were used to estimate the tau values, which define the intrinsic timescales of each brain area.
Each of these script calculates the timescales for a different group: adults (CamCAN), infants-Group1 (dHCP_halfsample), infants-Group2 (dHCP_independentsample).

The other python files include the analysis comparing the timescales between groups, both whole brain and devided by networks, and the correlation between the timescales in infants and the SNR values.

In the /data folder, we share the calculated intrinsic timescales in a subjXROI matrix, and other reference files that could be of interest to the readers.
